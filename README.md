# bias-bounty-data

Welcome to the first Humane Intelligence Bias Bounty Challenge. 

## Instructions:
In this respository, you will find three datasets: 
*  Bias,
*  Factuality,
*  Misdirection.
  
**Pick only ONE dataset for your project.** 


## Dataset Descriptions

### Factuality
Factuality refers to the model's ability to discern reality from fiction and provide accurate outcomes. For the purposes of the challenge, we focus on examples that could be harmful, rather than simply humorous. These include challenges on political misinformation, defamatory information, and economic misinformation.

| Statistic   | Number | Description   |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Variables  | 17  | The number of factors or colums in the dataset     |
| Observations    | 16,205  | The number of rows in the dataset     |
| Total Record Size in Memory | 2.1 MiB  | The size of the dataset      |


### Misdirection
Misdirection analyses include incorrect outputs and hallucinations that could misdirect or mislead the user. Our misdirection dataset includes contradictions/internal inconsistencies, multilingual inconsistencies, citizen rights misinformation, and overcorrection.

| Statistic   | Number | Description   |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Variables  |  17 | The number of factors or colums in the dataset     |
| Observations    |  15,599 | The number of rows in the dataset     |
| Total Record Size in Memory |  	2.0 MiB | The size of the dataset      |


### Bias
Bias analysis demonstrates and explores model biases. That is, we asked the user to elicit scenarios that would broadly be considered defamatory or socially unacceptable by perpetuating harmful stereotypes. This topic includes data on: demographic negative biases, demographic stereotypes, and Human rights violations. 

| Statistic   | Number | Description   |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| Variables  | 17  | The number of factors or colums in the dataset     |
| Observations    | 19,620  | The number of rows in the dataset     |
| Total Record Size in Memory | 2.6 MiB  | The size of the dataset      |
